## After Taking Screenshots

1. Save all screenshots to `docs/images/` folder
2. Rename them exactly as shown above (e.g., `download-zip.png`)
3. The README will automatically show them!

## Alternative: Use Placeholder Images

If you don't have time for screenshots right now, the README will still work! The image placeholders just won't show up, but students can still follow the text instructions.
